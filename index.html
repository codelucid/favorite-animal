                <li><strong>This bear roamed North America up to approximately 11,000 years ago. According to sources, it was the most common early North American bear.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>It's been estimated that the bears would have had to eat approximately 35 pounds of meat every day in order to survive.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Short-Faced Bear fossils have been found all over the world, from Alaska to Mississippi.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The bear's population would have peaked about 800,000 years ago.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Even with their incredible stature, the bears could run up to 40 miles per hour and chase prey or scare any other game away from the spoils of a successful hunt.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>A mature short-faced bear could reach a height of 14 feet when standing.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>The short-faced bear would weigh in at an unfathomable 2,000 pounds. A male grizzly, for comparison, weighs about 600.</strong></li>
